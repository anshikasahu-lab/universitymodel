1)Project Title
University Attendance Mangement System

2)Introduction
Attendance tracking is an essntial part of academic management in universities and colleges.Manual attendance systems often result in 
inaccuracies, data loss, and diffculty in retrieving information.
This project aims to develop a simple java based console application that allows faculty to record and view student attendance efficiently.

3)Problem Statement Traditional attendance methods such as paper rsgisters are time consuming prone to errors
,and inefficient for long term storage and retrieval.
There is a need for a simple digital sysstem that can:
.Store Student Details
.Record daily attendance 
.Retrieve attendance report quickly
.Be easy to run using basic java skills 

4)Objectives 
The objectives to this project are:
.To design a basic attendance management modeil using java.
.To maintain student records(Name,ID,Department).
.To Allow marking of attendance for any date.
.To generate attendance reports for individual students.
.To demonstarte object-oriented programming concepts.

5)Scope of the project
The system will include

1) Student Management
.Add new student details.

2)Attendance Recording
.Store present/absent status for entered dates.

3)Report Geneartion
.Displays a student's sttendance records.

4)Console interafce
.User-friendly text based menu.



OUT OF SCOPE (for now)
.Database Storage
.Web/GUI interface
.Percentage calculation
.Multi-user roles

These can be added in future upgrades


6)Methodology
The project uses:
Object-orieneted Programming Model 
.Students class to stor student infromation
.AttendanceRecord class to store attendance mapping 
.Main class to handle menu interactions

Java Collections
.ArrayList To store students
.Hashmap to store attendance date -> status

usser input
.Scanner class for concole based interactions.


7)Expected output
The system should:
.Successfully add students
.Allow marking Present/absent
.Exit the system smootly without errors



8)Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple yet effictive way to manage attendance using java. 
It highlights use of OOP principle and the collections framework,serving as a strong foundation for 
developing more adavnced university management system in the future.
